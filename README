This is a simple ssl client/server coded in python.
**NOTE** Current implementation is only over TCP, not yet wrapped by SSL (I need to set up certs)

Instructions:
  First run server by:
    python server.py
  Then run client by:
    python client.py
  Client should pass the variable 'message' to the server which in hand sends the same 'message' back to the client
